# Basic-Sudoku-Game
- The aim of this project is to implement a basic Sudoku board game
- It is developed using simple HTML table and JavaScript functionalities


Implementation Details:


  - The initial state of the game contains some fixed blocks with numbers already present
  - The user can tap on any blank block and input a number from 1-9
  - If the user inputs anything other than 1-9, an error alert will be displayed in the window
  - An error alert will also be shown if the user input does not validate as per the rules of Sudoku
  - A success alert will be shown when the user completes the game successfully
  - The user needs to click anywhere outside of the block to check if the input entered in that box is acceptable
